# AndroidChatClient

A very simple android app that will connect to the ChatServer. If you type
> logout

it will log you out of the server and exit the app. If no messages appear on screen after entering the server info, wait. To change the ip or port of the server, you will have to clear out the app data. Messages sent offline will be queued until the next time you connect to the server.
