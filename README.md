# AndroidChatClient

A very simple android app that will connect to the ChatServer Project. Must start the chat server first. This was a very quick protoype, so not much time was spent on a polished UI. Was testing out queueing offline messages and sending the queue when connection was re-established. If you type
> logout

it will log you out of the server and exit the app. If no messages appear on screen after entering the server info, wait. To change the ip or port of the server, you will have to clear out the app data. Messages sent offline will be queued until the next time you connect to the server.
